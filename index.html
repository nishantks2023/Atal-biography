                <h2>Top Leader of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee (born December 25, 1924, August 16, 2018,)</b>Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh,
                    India—died
                    New Delhi, Delhi was the leader of the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and twice served as
                    the prime minister of India (1996; 1998–2004).
                    <br></br>
                    Vajpayee was first elected to parliament in 1957 as a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), a
                    forerunner of the BJP. In 1977 the BJS joined three other parties to form the Janata Party, which
                    led a government that lasted until July 1979. As foreign minister in the Janata government, Vajpayee
                    earned a reputation for improving relations with Pakistan and China. In 1980, following a split in
                    the Janata Party, Vajpayee helped the BJS to reorganize itself as the BJP. In 1992 he was one of the
                    few Hindu leaders to speak out against the destruction of the historic mosque at Ayodhya by
                    anti-Muslim extremists.

                        Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister in May 1996 but was in office only 13 days, after
                        failing to attract support from other parties. In early 1998 he again became prime minister, in
                        elections in which the BJP won a record number of seats, but he was forced to make a shaky
                        alliance with regional parties. In 1999 the BJP increased its seats in parliament and
                        consolidated its hold on government.

                        Although considered a pragmatist, Vajpayee assumed a defiant posture in the face of Western
                        criticism of India’s testing of several nuclear weapons in 1998. 
                        <br>He had earlier been praised for
                        his conciliatory gestures toward India’s Muslim minority. In 2000 his government began an
                        extensive program of divestment of public funds from several key state-run industries.</br>  In 2002
                        Vajpayee’s government was criticized for its slowness in reacting to riots in Gujarat in which
                        some 1,000 people (primarily Muslims) died.Nevertheless, in 2003 Vajpayee made a concerted
                        effort to resolve India’s long-running feud with Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Under his
                        leadership, India achieved steady economic growth, and the country became a world leader in
                        information technology, though the poorer elements of Indian society often felt left out of the
                        economic prosperity. In 2004 his coalition was defeated in the parliamentary election, and he
                        resigned from office.

                        Vajpayee announced his retirement from politics at the end of 2005. In late December 2014 he was
                        awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour.
